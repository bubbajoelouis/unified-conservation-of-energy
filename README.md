<b>Full Title</b>: The Unified Conservation of Energy: Redefining the Fundamentals for a Coherent Understanding<br>
<b>Short Title</b>: Unified Conservation of Energy<br>
<b>Acronym: UCE</b>

<b>Short Description</b>: The Unified Conservation of Energy redefines the traditional concepts of energy to provide a more consistent and logically sound framework.

<b>Long Description</b>: The Unified Conservation of Energy presents a groundbreaking redefinition of energy by addressing logical inconsistencies in traditional frameworks and proposing a cohesive model grounded in three distinct states of energy: Radiation, Gravitation, and Particulate Motion. This unified approach refines the classical conservation law while preserving its core principles, offering clarity across scales—from subatomic interactions to cosmic phenomena.

<i>"Open Call for Collaboration – Unified Conservation of Energy

As the custodian of #TheoreticalPhysics on the internet, I invite collaboration on an article for a Unified Conservation of Energy Equation, grounded in The Unified Theory of Energy. 

Whether you’re curious or critical, your input is welcome. If no one responds, I’ll keep refining it solo."</i>
