<h1>Abstract</h1>
The Unified Conservation of Energy redefines the classical understanding of energy by proposing three interdependent states: Radiation (extended energy), Gravitation (potential energy stored within Mass), and Particulate Motion (kinetic energy). This framework clarifies inconsistencies in traditional models, such as the ambiguous concept of internal energy, by elevating Radiation to a fundamental state of energy that propagates beyond matter. The theory unifies these states in the equation E_total = E_extended + E_potential + E_kinetic, preserving the conservation law while providing a coherent lens for analyzing energy transformations across scales, from subatomic to cosmic. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of Radiation, Gravitation, and Particulate Motion, this approach refines our understanding of energy's true nature and establishes a foundation for future exploration of energetic processes.
